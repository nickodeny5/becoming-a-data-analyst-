# Hi, I'm Nick Odeny 👋 – Aspiring Data Analyst

I’m officially starting my data analysis journey today — December 2, 2025.

Zero experience → future data analyst. This repository will document every single step:
- First lines of Python
- First Pandas dataframe
- First SQL query
- First visualization
- …all the way to job-ready projects and dashboards

I’m committing to learning in public and pushing code almost every day.

### Current Level
- Day 1: Just created this repo
- Tools I know today: Excel (basic), nothing else yet
- Goal for 2026: Land my first data analyst/role

### What You’ll Find Here (as it grows)
- `01-beginner/` → My very first notebooks (expect messy code – that’s the point!)
- `02-intermediate/` → EDA, SQL, storytelling
- `03-advanced/` → Dashboards, forecasting, maybe some light ML
- `learning-log.md` → Daily one-sentence updates
- Certificates when I earn them

### Today’s Commit (Dec 2, 2025)
- Created the repository
- Wrote this README
- Installed Python & Jupyter for the first time

First real notebook coming in the next 24 hours!

Let’s go 🚀  
Feel free to follow along or give tips – I’m here to learn.
